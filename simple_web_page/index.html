    <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <b>HTML</b> and <b>css</b> from a <em>terriffic</em> class I'm taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com/course_catalog">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?</p>
    <p>There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML & CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &#60;p&#62; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.</p>
    <p>This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as an `id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline the entire paragraph.</p>
